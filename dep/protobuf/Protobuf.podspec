# This file describes to Cocoapods how to integrate the Objective-C runtime into a dependent

# Despite this file being specific to Objective-C, it needs to be on the root of the repository.
# Otherwise, Cocoapods gives trouble like not picking up the license file correctly, or not letting
# dependent projects use the :git notation to refer to the library.
