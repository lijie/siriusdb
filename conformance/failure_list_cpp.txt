# This is the list of conformance tests that are known to fail for the C++
# implementation right now.  These should be fixed.
#
# By listing them here we can keep tabs on which ones are failing and be sure
# that we don't introduce regressions in other tests.
#
# TODO(haberman): insert links to corresponding bugs tracking the issue.
# Should we use GitHub issues or the Google-internal bug tracker?
